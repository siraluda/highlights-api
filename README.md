# highlights-api
A beginner's guide to using apollo-server and graphiql to write a simple CRUD nodejs application

### What we have built
This API application is built using Graphql and Apolloserver and it is a gentle introduction to graphql and apollo.
This is an API application for book highlights, allowing us to store memorable passages from the things that we read. 
Users of the API will be able to perform “CRUD” (create, read, update, delete) operations against their highlights:

    *Create a new highlight
    *Read an individual highlight as well as a list of highlights
    *Update a highlight’s content
    *Delete a highlight
